# tRNAViz

A package that interfaces with the [Genomic tRNA Database](http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu) to visualize how many genomic copies of tRNAs exist in a given organism, along with any and all modifications at position 34 (the wobble base pair site). The output of this program is a postscript file which can be compiled into a PDF.
